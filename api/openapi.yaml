          Quantifies the revenue generated from `subscription` fees on a monthly basis. This figure is calculated post-application of applicable taxes and deduction of any applicable discounts. The method of calculation varies based on the subscription billing cycle:

          - Revenue from `monthly` subscription invoices is included in the MRR for the month in which the invoice is issued.
          - Revenue from `quarterly` subscription invoices is distributed evenly over three months. This distribution applies to fees paid in advance (allocated to the next remaining months depending on calendar or anniversary billing) as well as to fees paid in arrears (allocated to the preceding months depending on calendar or anniversary billing).
          - Revenue from `yearly` subscription invoices is distributed evenly over twelve months. This allocation is applicable for fees paid in advance (spread over the next  remaining months depending on calendar or anniversary billing) and for fees paid in arrears (spread over the previous months depending on calendar or anniversary billing).
          - Revenue from `weekly` subscription invoices, the total revenue from all invoices issued within a month is summed up. This total is then divided by the number of invoices issued during that month, and the result is multiplied by 4.33, representing the average number of weeks in a month.

            This field represents a unique identifier for the event.
            It is crucial for ensuring idempotency, meaning that each event can be uniquely identified and processed without causing any unintended side effects.

            WARNING: If the Lago organization is configured to use the new Clickhouse-based event pipeline (designed for high-volume processing), the idempotency logic is handled differently.
            Event uniqueness is maintained with both `transaction_id` and `timestamp` fields.
            If a new event arrives with identical values for these two fields as an existing event, the new one will overwrite the previous event rather than being rejected.

            This parameter configures the method of incrementing invoice numbers for your customers.

            - `per_customer`: Invoice numbers are incremented individually for each customer. This means every customer will have their own unique sequence of invoice numbers, separate from other customers. It ensures that each customer's invoice numbers follow a distinct and isolated numbering pattern.
            - `per_organization`: Invoice number incrementation is made across your entire organization. Rather than individual sequences for each customer, all invoices within the organization follow a single, unified numbering system. This creates a continuous and organization-wide sequence for all invoice numbers. Invoices are incremented per month (dynamic value used is YYYYMM), and invoice numbers are reset at the end of each month.

            The default value for `document_numbering` is set to `per_customer`, meaning that, unless changed, invoice numbers will increment uniquely for each customer.

            This parameter configures the method of incrementing invoice numbers for your customers.

            - `per_customer`: Invoice numbers are incremented individually for each customer. This means every customer will have their own unique sequence of invoice numbers, separate from other customers. It ensures that each customer's invoice numbers follow a distinct and isolated numbering pattern.
            - `per_organization`: Invoice number incrementation is made across your entire organization. Rather than individual sequences for each customer, all invoices within the organization follow a single, unified numbering system. This creates a continuous and organization-wide sequence for all invoice numbers. Invoices are incremented per month (dynamic value used is YYYYMM), and invoice numbers are reset at the end of each month.

            The default value for `document_numbering` is set to `per_customer`, meaning that, unless changed, invoice numbers will increment uniquely for each customer.
